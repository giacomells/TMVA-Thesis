These files can analyse DATA.root that are recorded in LHC at the ALICE experiment. 
If you really want to realize this analysis then contact me and I will provide the DATA that is needed.
To realize the Classification of the models you will also need the simulation SIGNAL.root that is generated with a MonteCarlo simulation.

Make sure to have installed the ROOT Data Analysis Framework from the site https://root.cern.ch

To create the Neural Networks just run the ClassificationsFiles, then you will be able to run the ApplicationFiles that actually proviede 
the DATA reelaborated from the NN. 

In the end, to have a better understanding, run the AnalysisFiles in ROOT. Read the README about it in the directory.
